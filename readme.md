### 4-6p

Brainstorm some ideas. We did some word association and listed out some games that can give inspiration. 

- Hollow Knight
- Pikman
- Spore
- The Borrowers
- Creatures
- Bugs Life
- Alice In Wonderland - The Walrus
- Norse by Norsewest
- World of Go
- Little Nightmares
- Siphonophorae

I keep coming to the gameplay mechanic of a group of little things that can come together and separate for different needs. This could be top down strategy game, or a side platformer. 

### 6-7p

Worked on the swarming of the mobs. They will move toward the player and follow them as they move. I added some quick debug text that is attached to the player scene.

### 7-10p

Made some artwork for a background and the boss of the game. It will scoop up you/the tiny creatures and you must overcome it. I also started to rewrite the player controls to move as a side scrolling platformer

Worked on adding the background "big guy" and getting the camera to follow the player around. Adding zoom via mouse wheel

It is all a more wonky than I would like. I don't really have a level yet, and the gravity/physics seems to be affecting the player characterbody2d
